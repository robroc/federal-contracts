# An analysis of Canadian federal contracts

This repo contrains Jupyter notebooks that prepare and analyze data Canadian federal contracts over $10,000, which are [published here](https://search.open.canada.ca/contracts/) ([full data download here](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/d8f85d91-7dec-4fd1-8055-483b77225d8b)).

This analysis was used in two reports by the Investigative Journalism Foundation:

* [Why do government IT contracts have such huge cost overruns?](https://theijf.org/why-do-government-it-contracts-have-such-huge-cost-overruns)
* [Ottawa spending record amounts outsourcing access to information requests](https://theijf.org/ottawa-spending-record-amounts-outsourcing-access-to-information-requests)
